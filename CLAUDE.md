# archfit

Architecture-fitness CLI (Go). Reads dependency facts from a target repo, checks
them against `.archfit.yaml`, emits gate violations + metrics for CI and AI agents.
Language facts come from external tools run out-of-process: `go list`,
dependency-cruiser, ast-grep, grimp, `cargo metadata`, jscpd, SCIP.

## Commands (Makefile)

- `make build` — static binary, `CGO_ENABLED=0` → `.bin/archfit`
- `make test` — `go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`
- `make lint` — `golangci-lint run -c .golangci.yaml ./...` (pinned v2.1.6)
- `make fmt` — `gofmt -s` + `goimports -local github.com/alexei-led/archfit`
- `make archfit` — dogfood architecture-drift gate: `.bin/archfit analyze --gate --config .archfit.yaml --full`
- `make arch-lint` — architecture drift linter (alias for `make archfit`); wired into the pre-push hook
- `make archfit-report` — write `reports/archfit-report.md` via `archfit analyze --markdown`
- `make mock` — regenerate moq fakes (`go generate ./...`)
- `make test-fast` — `go test -race -short ./...` (skips slow subprocess/ast-grep integration tests; for inner-loop speed)
- `make all` — fmt → lint → test → archfit
- One test: `go test ./internal/<pkg>/ -run TestName`

## Structural gates (CI runs these explicitly — keep green)

- Import ring: `go test ./internal/ -run TestArchImports`
- Golden output: `go test ./internal/engine/ -run TestGolden` — regenerate
  deliberately and inspect the diff; output changes are never automatic.
- Dogfood gate: `make archfit` — CI runs the same target after tests/goldens. Also
  runs locally pre-push via the `arch-lint` hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. The
  self-config (`.archfit.yaml`) gates its own architecture: forbidden-dependency
  ring + `forbidden_layer_direction` (fail).
  `public_api_type_leak` runs advisory (warn).

## Invariants

Enforced by `internal/arch_test.go`; extend that test when adding a boundary.

- Core ring (`classify`, `rules`, `metrics` + sub-packages, `status`, `staleness`,
  `facts`, `score`, `scope`, `syntax`) must not import `os`, `os/exec`, any YAML
  lib, or adapter packages — it decides over already-gathered facts. `score`
  synthesises the coupling_balance band from an already-computed `Diagnostic`.
  `syntax` classifies each source file (Production/Test/Generated/Vendor) and
  exposes `LookupFileClass`/`IsTestFile` used by the LOC walk and by metrics that
  filter on Production files.
- `internal/model/*` imports stdlib only.
- Every subprocess call goes through `toolrun.Runner` (interface in `internal/ports`);
  extractors in `internal/extract/{go,ts,py,rust}` are out-of-process adapters. No
  `exec.Command` in core code — fake the `Runner` in tests.
- **No gitnexus.** The `.gitnexus`/`.codegraph` index dirs are excluded from file
  walks (`scope.go`), but archfit does not run the tool and does not derive any
  per-module fact from it.
- **Severity source is `cl.Score.Band`** (`classify.go`, `Run`). `cl.Severity =
cl.Score.Band` after the scorer runs. `BalanceResult` is deleted — it was the
  old discrete severity table and is no longer called anywhere. Do not re-introduce
  it; the book formula (`ScoreVersion = "bc_score.v3"`) is the single severity source.
- **FileClass facility** (`internal/model/fileclass`, `internal/syntax/fileclass`).
  Every source file is classified as `Production | Test | Generated | Vendor` once
  during the LOC walk; the result is stored in `SizeSignals.FileClassIndex`. Use
  `syntax.LookupFileClass` for path→class lookup with fallback. Metrics that
  filter on Production files use this index and report the excluded count.
  Config override: top-level `file_class:` key (`FileClassDef`), projected via
  `Config.ForFileClass()` → `syntax.FileClassConfig`.
- **`archfit diff <ref>`** subcommand (`cmd/archfit/diff.go`). Creates a clean
  detached temp worktree at `<ref>`, scores both sides with the full advisory
  pipeline, and emits a dimension-by-dimension delta table. Off-gate, report-only
  (exit 0 on success, exit 3 on git/config error). Both sides use the current
  `--config`. Formats: `text` (default), `json`, `markdown`.
- **Owner inheritance for auto-registered synthetic submodules**
  (`classify.AugmentModulesFromGraph`, `AugmentGoWorkspaceModules`): propagates
  `owner` from the nearest config-declared ancestor module to each synthetic module.
  Fixes inter-submodule edges defaulting to `cross_module_different_owner` (D=10)
  on single-team repos with many cargo-modules or Go workspace members.
- **SCIP empty-index reports `partial`/`warn`** (`internal/extract/scip/scip_strength.go`).
  When the resolved edge map is empty (`len(m)==0`), `Coverage.Status` is set
  to `StatusPartial` with reason
  `"empty index (0 occurrences) — check path case / indexer version"`. Previously
  this reported `ok`, silently hiding a SCIP indexer failure.
- **scanRoot vs gitRoot decoupling.** `Scope.Root` = ScanRoot (the analysis
  boundary; all extractors walk this tree). `Scope.GitRoot` = `git rev-parse
--show-toplevel` (git ops only). `Scope.SubtreePrefix = rel(GitRoot, Root)`.
  `--root` absent ⇒ ScanRoot=GitRoot, prefix="" ⇒ byte-identical. Non-git full
  mode proceeds with `GitRoot=""` (history empty); delta mode without git is a
  hard error.
  **macOS APFS case-variant `--root` (Task 25, fixed):** `snapScanRoot` in
  `internal/scope/scope.go` uses `os.SameFile` (device+inode) to snap a
  case-variant scan root to the git root's canonical path, so
  `/users/…/repo` and `/Users/…/repo` resolve to the same scope on
  case-insensitive APFS. `filepath.EvalSymlinks` still handles symlinks;
  `snapScanRoot` handles the case-mismatch that EvalSymlinks cannot fix.
- **Go workspace loading.** Member discovery: `go.work` at or above ScanRoot
  (parsed in-process via `golang.org/x/mod/modfile`) → filter to members inside
  ScanRoot and not exclusion-matched; else single `go.mod`; else walk for `go.mod`
  dirs. Per-member `packages.Load({Dir: memberDir}, "./...")` concurrent
  (bounded to GOMAXPROCS). Per-package strip via `pkg.Module.Dir`. First-party =
  target `Module.Path` ∈ loaded member set. 1 surviving member = today's single-
  module path (byte-identical). `classify.AugmentGoWorkspaceModules` auto-registers
  each member as a synthetic module when **≥2** members were loaded and the
  member's `RelDir != "."` and no config module already covers it — mirrors the
  Rust `::` gate. `languages.go.modules.include/exclude` scopes which members load.
- **Per-analyzer timeout.** `analyzers.<x>.timeout` (Go duration string, e.g. `"5m"`)
  caps `scip` and `clones` (jscpd) subprocess runs. On timeout the result is
  dropped; dependent metrics report `n/a (timed out)`; the run continues on the
  verdict from the remaining analyzers.
- **Go edge strength** comes from `go/packages` type info (`NeedTypesInfo`): the
  resolved object kind (interface→contract, concrete type→model, func→functional)
  is compiler-grade ground truth, so SCIP does **not** override it — `enrichEdges`
  keeps the Go type-info hint and uses SCIP strength only where type-info is absent
  (empty hint). SCIP-go is a coarser subprocess re-derivation that collapses
  imports to a blanket `functional`; letting it override flattened
  `coupling_balance`'s strength signal. For TS/Py/Rust (heuristic extractor hints)
  SCIP **does** override — it is their precision upgrade. Unclassified edges stay
  `unknown` (abstain-not-fake). A public-glob match is a not-intrusive _floor_
  whose kind the hint refines (classify.go); an internal-glob match is
  authoritative intrusive.
- Parse config once into typed views; pass a package its view, not the whole config.
- LLM SDKs (`anthropic-sdk-go`, `openai-go`) are off-gate: only `enrich`,
  `autopilot`, `explain`, and `review` touch them, never `check`. Enforced
  structurally — `arch_test.go` forbids any `internal/*` package from importing
  `internal/llm`, so the LLM commands live in `cmd`.
- `gate:` is wired for **all rule types** (`off` skips, `warn` is advisory/non-blocking,
  `fail`/unset is blocking; exception: `public_api_change` defaults to `warn` when unset). An unknown `type` value is a config error.

## Coupling scorer — key design facts

`ScoreVersion = "bc_score.v3"` (`internal/model/coupling/scorer.go`).
Formula: `balance = max(|S−D|, 10−V) + 1` (Khononov Ch10 verbatim).
Ordinals frozen as named constants — changing any is a breaking metric change.

**Abstain-not-fake:** when strength OR distance is `unknown`, the edge is
unscored (`EdgeScore.Scored = false`). No invented ordinals. Genuine internal
edges with unknown strength stay in the `abstained` bucket (lowers
`coupling_balance` confidence); external/library edges (`DistanceUnknown`) are
excluded from the denominator entirely (counted in `classified_edges.external`).

**External edges excluded from `coupling_balance`:** edges whose target is not a
declared module are NOT internal coupling seams. Their count surfaces in
`classified_edges.external` and the `coupling_balance` evidence string.

**Symmetric from clones:** when `analyzers.clones` detects a cross-module clone
pair, the edge strength is upgraded to `StrengthSymmetric` (S=9) unless a
config-authoritative `contract`/`intrusive` or an approved pinned label already
applies.

**Provenance lowers confidence:** approved labels in `.archfit-labels.yaml` with
`provenance: llm` and `confidence` below `high` lower `coupling_balance`
confidence by one band. `provenance: human` and `provenance: tool` do not.

**Opt-in volatility cascade:** `coupling.volatility_cascade: true` in
`.archfit.yaml` enables a single-hop propagation pass (book Ch9) that raises
effective volatility to `high` for modules strongly coupled to a `core` module.
archfit's own self-config has this enabled.

**Runtime async is report-only:** `runtime_async` JSON field records async-bridge
evidence per module. Never annotates graph edges, never affects distance or
balance score, never gates. This is a deliberate design decision — do not wire
async detection into distance.

## Release (tag-triggered — never release manually)

`git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m … && git push origin vX.Y.Z` → `release.yaml` builds binaries +
multi-arch image, pushes `ghcr.io/alexei-led/archfit:<tag>` + `:latest`, and its
`release` job runs `gh release create` itself. A second `gh release create` (or a
release tool) collides on the tag and fails the job.

## Runtime image

`Dockerfile` is `debian:bookworm-slim` (glibc; musl broke ast-grep) — one image with
Go SDK, git, Node 24, dependency-cruiser, ast-grep (`sg`), uv, python3; non-root.
The Rust toolchain (`cargo`, `rust-analyzer`) is **not** bundled — Rust analysis
reports `n/a` (never fails) in the image; run on a host with cargo or extend it.
`archfit doctor` checks tools; `sg` must resolve to ast-grep, not util-linux. Build
amd64 in CI, not local emulation.

## Rust analysis granularity

Rust crate facts are **crate-level**: `cargo metadata` makes one graph node per
workspace member. The scorer caps a **degenerate graph** (<2 connected modules,
e.g. a single crate) at `mixed` — it never scores `strong` on a one-node graph (see
`internal/score`, `degenerateGraph`). Opt-in `analyzers.cargo_modules.enabled`
adds an **intra-crate module graph** (`<crate>::<mod>` nodes + aggregated `uses`
edges), so single-crate projects get real cycle/blast-radius/cohesion signal.
Opt-in `analyzers.scip.enabled` runs rust-analyzer SCIP, which produces a correct
`<crate>::<mod>` strength map and attaches `StrengthHint` to those module edges. The
engine then registers auto-discovered module nodes as modules
(`classify.AugmentModulesFromGraph`, gated on the `::` separator so Go/TS/Python are
untouched) so distance/volatility classify and the strength is consumed — verified on
herdr: `coupling_balance` measures (was n/a). `encapsulation`
stays `n/a` for typical Rust by design: it scores only contract/intrusive edges, and
Rust's module privacy makes cross-module _intrusive_ edges rare. With all three on
(`languages.rust` + `analyzers.cargo_modules` + `analyzers.scip`) a single-crate
Rust project gets full module-level coupling analysis.

The extractor carries crate roots (`graph.CrateRoot`, repo-relative src dir + crate
name from cargo metadata) on the graph, and `modgraph.ModuleKeyResolver` maps a
`.rs` file to its module key (`crate/src/a/b.rs → crate::a::b`) so per-file metrics
resolve to module granularity instead of collapsing every file to the crate. It is
filesystem convention (accepted ceiling: `#[path]`, inline `mod {}`, `include!`
diverge from rust-analyzer's semantic tree; SCIP is the precision upgrade).
